<br>
An armband that monitors the enviroment. It is planned to have at <br>
least the following abilities:<br>
- RTC synced to ntp<br>
- Temp sensor<br>
- humidity sensor<br>
- barometeric sensor<br>
- UV sensor<br>
- Lightning sensor<br>
<br>
Maybe more depending on room on the armband<br>
and battery capacity.<br>
<br>
This is so alpha software. it is alpha-alpha<br>
software.<br>
<br>
Will be updating more frequently. (I hope)<br>
<br>
Ran into trouble with the MH-ET LIVE Pulse/Oximeter sensor from Amazon.<br>
It needed a solder bridge on the back to select 1.8V or 3.3V <br>

although I think mine has solder pads to deal with this,<br>
